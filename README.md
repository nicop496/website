# Nicolás Pujía's website

Here is the source code of my personal website. If everything is working correctly, you should be able to find it live at [nicolaspujia.com](https://nicolaspujia.com).

It's made with Django and TailwindCSS.

I don't give instructions for anything, but you can do whatever you want with the code here. Anyways, I would really appreciate if you give me credits or if you tell me that you are using it. That's all, enjoy!
