# Nicolás Pujía's website

Here is the source code of my personal website. If everything is working correctly, you should be able to find it live at [nicolaspujia.com](https://nicolaspujia.com).

## How to run & edit it locally

1. Clone the repository on a folder of your choice.

2. - If you have Node.js installed, run `npm install -D tailwindcss`.
   - Otherwise, you can download Tailwind's standalone executable from [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.4.0).

3. Run Tailwind with `tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./src/styles.css --watch` (add `npx` at the beginning if you installed Tailwind via Node.js).

4. Open an HTML file on your browser or start Live Server extension on VSCode (recommended).

5. Save your changes and watch the results on your browser (if you opened the HTML file directly, you'll have to refresh the page).
