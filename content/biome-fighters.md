1v1 **online multiplayer** [platform fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_fighter) game with a retro aesthetic, where there are more than just two platforms and *every corner is an opportunity for the victory*. It is inspired in [Spelunky's deatchmath](https://spelunky.fandom.com/wiki/Deathmatch_(HD)), but taken to a competitive online multiplayer environment.

Please note that the current version is prototype, so a lot of [initial ideas for the game](https://github.com/nicopujia/biome_fighters/labels/Enhancement) are not implemented. It only includes a minimal playable experience in a map with some platforms, with one biome (the desert) and one character (the cactus).
