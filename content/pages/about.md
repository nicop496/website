## Summary

I am Nicolás Pujia, a **software engineer** from Buenos Aires, **Argentina**. Since 2020, I have passionately been transforming ideas into [real software](/portfolio.html). With [experience]({filename}/siderplast.md) in **full-stack** development, I can design, develop, and deploy scalable, user-focused applications.

Feel free to reach out at <contact@nicolaspujia.com> to discuss how my skills and experience can benefit your company.

## Experience

* Implemented a large, [commercial project]({filename}/siderplast.md) for a [client](https://siderplast.com.ar/nosotros/), currently [in production](https://siderplast.com.ar/).
* Built a real-time [online multiplayer game]({filename}/biome-fighters.md) recognized for being innovative.
* Published multiple apps on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8059097220194731179), [one of them](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nicopujia.gamefinder) downloaded by 500+ users worldwide and with 5-stars rating.
* Created 10+ [projects with Python](/portfolio/technologies/python.html), obtaining extensive knowledge about the language and programming in general.

## Skills

### Technical

Python, Django, Docker, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Flutter, Godot Engine.

### Non-technical

Self-initiative, critical and logical thinking, teamwork.

## Journey

### Early exploration

I started at the age of 12 by developing projects on my own with **Python**, including web scraping tools, video games, automation scripts, mobile and desktop applications, and [more](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). I also learned **Godot** as I wanted to create *mobile* [games](/portfolio/technologies/godot.html).

### More personal projects

At the end of 2022 and during 2023, I learned **Flutter** to create *high-performance* multi-platform [software](/portfolio/technologies/flutter.html). At the same time, I started using **Git** & **GitHub** to keep better track of my projects. I successfully published those first apps and video games to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8059097220194731179).

In late 2023 and the beginning of 2024, I experimented with **computer networking** to create an online multi-platform, multiplayer [video game]({filename}/biome-fighters.md). I developed the prototype, set it aside, and a few months later, I was called to [participate in BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters) because they had found my project interesting. Although I did not end up at the top, I quickly learned how to deal with **deadlines**.

### From hobbyist to professional

After that, thanks to a [friend](https://franciscoaurelio.com) of mine, I got my first paid and really large [project]({filename}/siderplast.md) for a client. Although I had experience with **FastAPI** from my previous project, I chose to specialize in **Django** while developing this one, as it was a better fit for its requirements. I also learned **Docker**, **MySQL**, and **Nginx** in the process, as well as non-technical skills like **handling large projects** and **dealing with clients**. I constantly refined the scalability of the code to ensure the project remained sustainable.

## Beyond programming

I have always enjoyed playing football ⚽️ and other kinds of physical activity. Although I was not naturally talented, it taught me **persistence**—never giving up even when things get tough. Moreover, **teamwork** is an essential skill when playing this sport, and that’s another skill I have learned and even been awarded for.
