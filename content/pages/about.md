## Journey

### *Early* projects

I started at the age of 12 by developing projects on my own with **Python**, including web scraping tools, video games, automation scripts, mobile and desktop applications, and [more](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). I also learned **Godot** as I wanted to create *mobile* [games](/portfolio/technologies/godot.html).

### Developing for the *world*

At the end of 2022 and during 2023, I learned **Flutter** to create *high-performance* multi-platform [software](/portfolio/technologies/flutter.html). At the same time, I started using **Git** & **GitHub** to keep a better track of my projects. I ended up publishing those first apps and video games to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8059097220194731179).

### Experimenting *new* technologies

At the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, I experimented with **computer networking** in order to create an online multi-platform, multiplayer [video game]({filename}/biome-fighters.md). I developed the prototype, set it aside, and a few months later, I was called to [participate in BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters) because they had found my project interesting. Although I did not end up in the top, I quickly learned how to deal with **deadlines**.

### Time to earn some *money*

After that, thanks to a [friend](https://franciscoaurelio.com) of mine, I got my first paid —and really large— [project]({filename}/siderplast.md) for a [client](https://siderplast.com.ar/nosotros/). Because it was a full-stack web application, I had to learn a backend technology, so I got on my way of specializing with **Django** at the same time I was developing the project. I also learned **Docker**, **MySQL** and **Nginx**, as well as non-technical skills like **handling large projects** and **dealing with clients**. Besides, I had to constantly refine the **code scalability**, otherwise the project would have become unsustainable.

## Beyond software development

I have always enjoyed playing football ⚽️ and doing other kinds of physical activity. But as I was not naturally talented for it, that is something that taught me **persistence** —not giving up even when things get tough—, something *quite* useful in this field. Besides, **teamwork** is a must-have skill when playing this sport, and that's another skill that I have learned and even awarded for.
