## Journey

### Early projects

I started at the age of 12 by developing projects on my own with **Python**, including web scraping tools, video games, automation scripts, mobile and desktop applications, and [more](https://github.com/nicopujia/old_projects). I also learned **Godot** as I wanted to create *mobile* [games](/portfolio/technologies/godot.html).

### Developing for the world

At the end of 2022 and during 2023, I learned **Flutter** to create *high-performance* multi-platform [software](/portfolio/technologies/flutter.html). At the same time, I started using **Git** & **GitHub** to keep better track of my projects. I ended up publishing those first apps and video games to the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8059097220194731179).

### Experimenting with new technologies

At the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, I experimented with **computer networking** to create an online multi-platform, multiplayer [video game]({filename}/biome-fighters.md). I developed the prototype, set it aside, and a few months later, I was called to [participate in BackdropBuild v3](https://backdropbuild.com/builds/v3/biome-fighters) because they had found my project interesting. Although I did not end up in the top, I quickly learned how to deal with **deadlines**.

### Time to earn some money

After that, thanks to a [friend](https://franciscoaurelio.com) of mine, I got my first paid—and really large—[project]({filename}/siderplast.md) for a [client](https://siderplast.com.ar/nosotros/). Since it was a full-stack web application, I had to learn backend technology. Although I had already tried FastAPI, I began specializing in Django while developing the project, as it was a better fit for its requirements. I also learned **Docker**, **MySQL**, and **Nginx**, as well as non-technical skills like **handling large projects** and **dealing with clients**. I constantly refined the code's scalability to ensure the project remained sustainable.

## Beyond software development

I have always enjoyed playing football ⚽️ and other kinds of physical activity. Although I was not naturally talented, it taught me **persistence—never giving up even when things get tough**. Besides, **teamwork** is a must-have skill when playing this sport, and that’s another skill I have learned and even been awarded for.
