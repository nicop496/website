title: GitJournal test
---

This article is just a test. I'm using the app GitJournal to see if it fits my needs of writing content for my website on the go.

Conclusion: it's better to just open my repo from GitHub and edit from there. GitJournal is somewhat buggy. For example, I realized that the changes of some commits I had made previously had just dissapeared, so I had to use the `git cherry-pick` command in order to restore them. Quite annoying.
