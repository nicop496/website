(Another) mobile platformer video game where you have to beat the levels as fast as possible, not only because of the timer but also because there is a light ray behind you. If you stay still, you get electrocuted! In order to go faster, the character can dash.

I didn't know how to name it so that's why chose "Jueguito Piola", which in Spanish means something like "good little game".

I remember sharing it with my classmates. At its time, we were all playing and competing to see who beated the (only three) levels faster. And I, the developer, wasn't even the best at it. Pretty funny moments.

## Screenshots

There are like two versions: the initial one and the "RTX" one, where I added special effects such as lights and new sprites.
