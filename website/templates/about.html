                I am from
                <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Buenos+Aires,+Cdad.+Aut%C3%B3noma+de+Buenos+Aires/" class="link" target="_blank">
                    Buenos Aires, Argentina â†—
                </a>
                and, more than just a <strong>software developer</strong>, I consider myself an ambitious individual who believes that we can always improve, both ourselves and the world around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an <strong>inconformist</strong>, I constantly strive for better solutions and innovative ideas. Software development is the bridge I use to materialize that belief, turning concepts into reality and always pushing the boundaries of what I am capable of (and, maybe in a future, of what is even possible).

                So, take a look around, explore <a href="{{ portfolio_url }}" class="link">my portfolio</a> and, if you think that I can be helpful to you, just contact me! I'm always eager for new projects.
